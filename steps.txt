1. Install Calaba.sh, 

- Ruby (ruby -v in a terminal should print ruby 1.8.7 or higher, Iâ€™ve got 2.0.0)

For iOS:
- A mac running Xcode.
- The iOS project to play with, found in

For Android: 
- The Android SDK installed and the environment variable ANDROID_HOME set pointing to it
- Ant installed and added to your path
- The APK that we use to demo on, found here: 

To install Calaba.sh for Android:
- Run sudo gem install calabash-android
(source: https://github.com/calabash/calabash-android/blob/master/documentation/installation.md)

To install Calaba.sh for iOS:
- cd into your project folder (workspaces did not work very well), the one containing the .xcodeproj file. 
- run sudo gem install calabash-cucumber

To Create a calabash target for your iOS project:
- calabash-ios setup (answer the questions)
- calabas-ios gen
- In Xcode, build the project using the -cal scheme
(source. https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios)


2.Look what you got, on iOS under /Library/Ruby/Gems/[version]/gems/ 
The things starting with calabash contains stuff that will be used. You do not have to understand or modify any of these 

3. Write feature files, using cucumber syntax. Look at the predefined steps. When you need a step not yet defined, add it in a steps file. 

4. Test on Android by standing in the same folder as your apk and run
	calabash-android run notes.apk 
And on iOS by standing in the same folder as your features folder and run
	cucumber 

5. When you have written a good step, merge it back in to master, so that we all can enjoy it.
